# Grapheme to phoneme - Teanu (tkw)

The g2p tables list the phonemes used in the IPA transcription of Teanu recordings provided in the [Pangloss collection](https://pangloss.cnrs.fr/corpus/Teanu?lang=fr&mode=pro).
They were obtained by extracting all the unique IPA symbols used in the transcription files.

The two tables differ by how labialization is handled:

* **roman_to_ipa :**  lists labialized stops as two separate phonemes.
  * For example, [pw] is transcribed as [p w]

* **roman_to_ipa2 :** lists liabialized stops as one phoneme using the diacritic [ʷ].
  * For example, [pw] is transcribed as [pʷ]
