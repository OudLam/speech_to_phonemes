# Grapheme to phoneme - Koyi Rai (kkt)

The g2p table maps each grapheme used in the text transcription of Koyi Rai to its corresponding IPA symbol.

This mapping was obtained by listing all the graphemes present in the transcription files and finding their pronunciation through the phonetic description of Koyi Rai presented in [Lahoussois. (2009)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5v01m1v6).

Two different tables are provided here, and differ by how aspirated obstruents are handled:

* **roman_to_ipa :** lists the different realizations of obstruents, as presented in [Lahoussois. (2009)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5v01m1v6).
  * For example, both [b] and [bʰ] are listed in the table as two different phonemes.

* **roman_to_ipa2 :** lists only the unaspirated realization of obstruents and the diacritic [ʰ] separately.
