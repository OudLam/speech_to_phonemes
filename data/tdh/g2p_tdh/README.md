# Grapheme to phoneme - Thulung Rai (tdh)

The g2p tables list the phonemes used in the IPA transcription of Thulung Rai recordings provided in the [Pangloss collection](https://pangloss.cnrs.fr/corpus/Thulung_Rai?lang=fr&mode=pro).
They were obtained by extracting all the unique IPA symbols used in the transcription files.

The two tables differ by how the diacritic for aspiration is handled:

* **roman_to_ipa :** both the diacritic [ʰ] and the fully realized phoneme [h] are mapped to the phoneme [h].

* **roman_to_ipa_diacritics :** there is a distinction between the diacritic for aspiration [ʰ] and the fully realized phoneme [h].
