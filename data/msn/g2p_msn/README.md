# Grapheme to phoneme - Mwesen (msn)

The g2p table maps the graphemes used in the text transcription of Mwesen recordings to its corresponding IPA symbol.

They were obtained by extracting all the unique graphemes present in the transcription files.

The grapheme to phoneme correspondence of vowels was determined by the description of the phonological vowel system found in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwesen_language).
