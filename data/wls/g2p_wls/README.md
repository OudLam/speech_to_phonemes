# Grapheme to phoneme - Wallisien (wls)

The g2p table maps the graphemes used in the text transcription of Wallisien to their corresponding IPA symbols.

This mapping was obtained by listing all the graphemes present in the transcription files and finding their pronunciation through the phonetic description of Wallisien presented in [Moyse-Faurie. (2016)](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01477387/document).

Two different tables are provided here:
* **roman_to_ipa :** tonic accent is ignored.
  * For example, [a] [à] and [á] are all mapped to the same phoneme [a]

* **roman_to_ipa_2 :** distinguishes phonemes with tonic accent.
 * For example, [à] [á] and [a] are mapped to the three different phonemes [à] [á] and [a]
