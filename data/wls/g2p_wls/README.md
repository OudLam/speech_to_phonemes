# Grapheme to phoneme - East Uvean (wls)

The g2p table maps the graphemes used in the text transcription of East Uvean to their corresponding IPA symbols.

This mapping was obtained by listing all the graphemes present in the transcription files and finding their pronunciation through the phonetic description of East Uvean presented in [Moyse-Faurie, (2016)](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01477387/document).

Two different tables are provided here:
* **roman_to_ipa :** tonic accent is ignored.
  * For example, [a] [à] and [á] are all mapped to the same phoneme [a]

* **roman_to_ipa_2 :** distinguishes phonemes with tonic accents.
 * For example, [à] [á] and [a] are respectively mapped to the three different phonemes [à] [á] and [a]
